Full Stack Developer, obsessed with understanding how stuff works.

I believe that personal and professional fulfillment are tightly linked with acquiring mastery in our art form, thus for me it is imperative to be in a place where I can improve myself both technically and personally.

Currently, I've been working with Typescript/Javascript both at the frontend with React and at the backend. Also, I'm used to supporting the construction of CI/CD pipelines and monitoring services.

I'm experienced in C++ as well, as this is my first programming language and with which I've written some of my personal projects.

I'm also interested in Mathematics, Logic, Formal Languages, Parsing Theory and Proof Assistants.
